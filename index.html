		<h3>About Me</h3>

		<p>
		I'm a digital marketing manager with experience in a variety of areas: PPC, SEO, email, social media, e-commerce and website development. I love digital marketing and the digital world, because it allows me to connect with everyone at every corner of the world.
		</p> 

		<p>
		My business experience and MBA degree makes me a practical thinker. I identify business goals, value proposition, competitive landscape and target customer segments. I then develop marketing strategy, plans and campaigns accordingly.
		</p>

		<p>
		I'm learning front-end and back-end web development, because I love programming and creating interesting websites and apps to connect with users and help them do what they want to do in an effective way
		</p> 

		<p>
		I enjoy having conversation with anyone who is interested in the Internet world or have questions about digital marketing. I believe the best ideas come from discussion and collaboration. Feel free to drop me a line at <a href="mailto:wenya.chang@live.com">wenya.chang@live.com</a>. I look forward to connecting with you.
